# Assignment: Understanding IEEE 754 Floating Point Numbers - Practical Exercises
AD 315 Assignment

## Requirements
For these exercises, students can use a programming language that supports IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic (like Python, Java, or C++).

### Convert Decimal to IEEE 754 Format
Write a function to convert a decimal number to its IEEE 754 32-bit single-precision floating-point binary representation.

### Arithmetic Operations
Perform the following arithmetic operations in your chosen programming language and show the IEEE 754 results:
0.1 + 0.2
1.0/3.0
Explain any discrepancies observed from the expected decimal results.

### Special Values Handling
Write code to generate positive infinity, negative infinity, and NaN using arithmetic operations. Verify by checking their properties (like checking if NaN is not equal to itself).

### Rounding Modes
Experiment with different rounding modes available in your programming environment. Provide examples where different rounding modes lead to different results.

### Underflow and Overflow
Demonstrate underflow and overflow scenarios with specific examples.

### Visualizing Precision Loss
Create a plot to visualize the loss of precision that occurs as numbers become very small (denormalized numbers) or very large.

### Comparative Study
Compare how different programming languages or systems handle IEEE 754 arithmetic differently. This can involve differences in default rounding modes, how exceptions like overflow or underflow are handled, etc.
